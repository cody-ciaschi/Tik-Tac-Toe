# Tik-Tac-Toe
This is a simple Tik-Tac-Toe game written in React.

## Usage
To use:
- Ensure you have nodejs>=14.0.0 and http-server installed.
- Clone the repo
- In your favorite terminal editor, navigate to the cloned directory and call `http-server -c-1`.
- Go to your favorite browser and go to `localhost:8080` (you can also copy the address from the command line)

- Enjoy!

## Roadmap to Future Improvements
In the future I plan to implement a games won board, and the ability to enter the players names.
